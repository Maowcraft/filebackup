Try to write a program that perfectly mimics the code that made these 3 data files.


Use these hints:


1. The original program was developed in Java (NOT Groovy/Scala/Kotlin)

2. The original program uses a custom class.

3. The original program uses Gson for serialization.

4. The original program uses ThreadLocalRandom to create random values.
